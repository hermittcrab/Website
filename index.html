            8/21-8/24 Week 1 <br>
                This is my first journal entry. We learned about the engineering process and safety rules. Along with figuring out how to create a website and edit it to our liking.
            I have the ability to do this using AWS, GITHUB, and html code. These are all fundamental aspects that allows me to create and edit the text that will be displayed to the website.
           These websites will allow me to document all the activities and lessons I have learned in this class.

            8/28-8/31 Week 2 <br>
                   This is my second journal entry. This week we were introduced Rude Goldberg machins and tinker cad which is a 3D modeling program. I learned about the 
               machines that were used back in the day to advance the quality of life. Such as a lever, pulley system, wedge, incline,wheel,and screw. With these simple
               mechanics, my table group and I were asked to create a system that pops a balloon, all while having limited supplies. We rough drafted a simple design but 
               over the week edited it to make it the best it could be.Then we modeled this in tinker cad. Another assignment incorporated with Tinker Cad was
                to create a home appliance. I chose to make an open fridge, displaying its containments. Unfortunately, I did not have enough time 
               to fill it with food like I intended to. We also took an engineering design quiz and worked on our Goldrudeberg machine model in Tinker Cad.

            9/5-9/8 Week 3 <br>
                   This is my third journal entry. Prior to last week, we finalized our rude goldberg machine on tinker cad and started manufacturing it with limited materials.
               My tablemate, Emma, was in charge of handling our supplies. We started with a large piece of cardboard and drew precise lines to help us cut the same measurements of our tinkercad model.
               Cherin, my other tablemate, used a box cutter to cut out the pieces we needed for the incline and railing. At first, while Cherin was cutting, Emma and I just watched
               on the side, not doing anything else. In order to speed up production, we decided to all focus on different parts of our machine. This week we weren't able to  
               start connecting things together but we were able to start cutting some cardboard pieces.

            9/11/-9/15 Week 4 <br>
                   This is my fourth journal entry. This week we worked on our rude goldberg machine using carboard and other materials. During the whole 
               tuesday period all we did was cut and contruct our design. Unfortunately, we were not able to add a pulley machine due to the lack of time.
               The next period we had was another working period on our machine.Our first time testing it with a balloon was unsuccessful. The problem was 
               the baseball wouldn't fall into the cardboard car box.To fix it we adjusted the position of the lever. Once this problem was solved, another error occured.
               Even when the ball fell in the car, there was not enough force to push the needle into the ballon. After many adjustements and tinkering,it finally popped.
               I think this is because we adjusted the two cars taped to the bottom of the car box. This allowed it to gain more speed and resist friction, thus 
               creating enough force to pop the balloon. Mission Success.

            9/18/-9/21 Week 5 <br>
                   This is my fifth journal entry. This week I took part in a challenge with the goal of creating a paper flotation device that holds weights. In order
                   to win, your device had to hold the most amount of weight compared to the class for five mnutes. We had limited time so I had to act fast. I cut my paper
                   into a square so I can make an evenly shaped box. With my extra paper, I folded them and created two hollow cylinders. These were to give the box extra support
                   when floating. I put 106 grams of weight in my box and it was able to stay afloat for 5 times.

            9/24/-9/28 Week 6 <br>
                   This is my sixth journal entry. This week I took apart a PC with my groupmates. And once we correctly dismantled all the parts, we then
                   put it back together. During this process I learned about the location and functions of the necessary parts of a PC. Such as the motherboard, CPU,
                   RAM, heat sink, GPU, etc. After that we took a quiz about the intro to engineering and the main functions of a computer.

            10/1/-10/4 Week 7 <br>
                   This is my seventh journal entry. This week I learned about how prosthetics are made and utilized to benefit individuals with disabilities. Such as
                   nerve sensored arms that react to the patients nerves in their arms. This allows the patient to control a functional arm. As an experiment, 
                   we created a 3D model of a prosthetic for an animal of our choice. I chose a capybaras front leg.

                   This is my eight journal entry. This week learned about aerospace engineering.From the new knowledge I gained, I then designed a rocket prototype on tinker cad. 
                   The purpose of this is to create a model that will hopefully fly a good distance once it is made in real life. I decided to make it more like a place
                   since planes fly forward, compared to rockets which fly up. I made it very simple. A wing on each side of the base, a pointy cone tip on the front, and a little shark fin
                   at the top to give it more direction.

            10/14/-10/19 Week 9 <br>
                   This is my ninth journal entry. This week I created a rocket prototype out of a bottle and cardboard. Then using a water pressure device, it shot the protoype across
                   a field. Unfortunately, our design did not travel very far. It had a pressure of 60 and a about 3/4 cup of water in the bottle. I think the reason it did not travel 
                   far is because there was not enough water to weigh it down, which is why it spiraled backwards instead of traveling forward. If I could do it again then I would add much more water
                   and even increase the pressure by a little.

            10/21/-10/25 Week 10 <br>
                   This is my tenth journal entry. This week my partner and I created a water filtration system. We did this by utilizing a water bottle,cotton 
                    balls, rocks, pebbles and sand in order to filter dirty water into clean drinkable water. The way we ordered our supplies was the big rocks on 
                    the very top, then the pebbles, then the sand, and finally the cotton balls on the bottom. We placed the cotton balls at the bottom in order for it to hold all
                   the rocks and pebbles from falling into the water. And the big rocks were on top to filter any big solid objects. Then from there, the materials only
                   got finer and finer. The reason for this is to filter the water for smaller particles as it travels farther down the system. After running the dirty water through the materials about 4 times, 
                    our water result was yellow with no solid particles. So, our system successfully removed any solid objects or particles from the original black water, 
                    and turned it into gray water. Although even after filtering it, I still wouldn't advise it to be ingested or used.

            10/30/-11/03 Week 11 <br>
                   This is my eleventh journal entry. This week learned about electrical engineering and how to manipulate circuits components to make a light glow. More specifically, I learned about
                   current, resistors, diodes, and voltage. As well as how electricity flows in a circle. It comes out of the positive side and circles back into the negative side. This new information allowed me
                   to tinker an accurate electrical current that powers and LED.

            11/07-11/11 Week 12 <br>
                   This is my twelvth  journal entry. This week my partner and I worked on lab 3 and 4 and building circuits by a breadboard. In order to to this we had to utilize resistors
                   and LED's to manipulate circuits in parallel and in series. We used an Arduino board to code the program for the ciruit, however, it was not working for many studens. 
                   Even if the code was right, the program would not activate the desired results. This caused a setback to the entire classroom. So unfortunately, my partner and I were unable
                   to complete lab 3 or even start lab 4 due to this error.

                   This is my thirteenth journal entry. This week I learned about the many qualities of buisness engineering and watched a slideshow discussing it.  I was introduced to the four fields of buisness. 
                   We also started brainstorming a shark tank idea in our table groups. The class watched an old shark tank pitch that was introducing the product "scrub daddy"
                   and it showed us to how make a successfull pitch. Aswell as what we should be including in our presentation. At first we were discussing the idea
                   of producing trained butler monkeys, but that seems to unethical.

                   This is my fourteenth journal entry. This week I had to complete and present a project with my table group. We had to create a successfull product that is functional and is something
                   that people would be willing to buy. It was based off shark tank so we needed to make a product that fuffills a persons daily problem. What my group and I came up with, is a wireless 
                   measuring object. This product is meant for individuals in fields such as construction, carpentry, and tailoring. It is basically a device that utilizes sensors in order to record 
                   the distance between them. It is an easier and more precise way to measure long and short ranges.

                      <li>Unfortunately, I did not catch the weight of our bridge but I am guessing it’s around 2000 grams?? 
                      Once I return I shall ask my groupmates for the exact weight for a precise ratio of the bridge weight and weight of water held.</li>
                      <li>AI also did not catch my weight held but I remember it held almost ¾ of a bucket worth before we stopped, due to the ends starting to give out. 
                      Again, I will get the exact weight once I return.</li>
                      <li>Unknown…</li>
                      <li>The heaviest part of our bridge was probably the center. This is because we used the most noodles in this area to reinforce the strength and to provide maximum support.
                      The excess glue also added to the heaviness from the middle. However, I think it would have been more successful if we applied more support on the ends, since that was the areas that held up the bridge. </li>
                      <li>Our bridge design was inspired by the structure of a truss bridge. A truss bridge is contructed of numerous small pieces into a series of interconnected triangles. 
                      We chose this type of bridge structure because they are known to be extremely strong and could withstand extreme conditions. 
                      These aspects were perfect for our assignment since it would have to survive the weight of a bucket of water. It’s durability proved to be successful once we conducted the experiment</li>
                      <li>Our design did not work as intended. Originally, we were supposed to have two sides and a platform in the middle, but due to lack of time and materials, we thought it was best to combine both sides together.
                      However, this worked for the better. It was more durable since it was double layered and we could use spare materials to strengthen the structure.</li>
                      <li>Our expected weakest point would be the middle of the bridge. This is due to the fact that the water bucket would be applying the most pressure in that area.
                      As well as because the middle was the farthest point from the two endpoints, which held up the bridge. Our hypothesis proved correct since it gave out the quickest in the center. </li>
                      <li>I believe we could improve our bridge by adding more triangles within the structure. This is because the triangles were what supported the weight of the bucket. 
                      Along with covering the noodles in a bit more glue. The glue made the noodles bendy and more durable to the weight. It prevented the noodles from snapping. </li>

                  This is my first week back during semester two. Unfortunately, I was absent during the entirety of this week, so I missed the lessons and projects done in class.
                  However, after independently viewing the slides, I learned about chemical engineering. Chemical engineering is the branch of engineering that deals with chemical production
                  and manufacturing products through chemical processes. There are many different duties that chemical engineers have. This includes, ensuring compliance with health, safety, and environmental
                  regulations, conducting research, estimating production processes, and much more. Along with this, chemical engineering contains a wide range of fields. Such as metallurgy, material science, oil exploration,
                  nuclear reprocessing, etc.

                  This is my second journal entry for semester 2. This week my partner and I worked on completing our project proposal. The main purpose of this proposal is to
                  develop a mouse trap car that travels a far distance. The proposal was made up of many components. This includes the project description, project research,
                  design constraints, bill of materials, schedule of milestones, and the team member biographies. After watching a video about the factors that make up a good mouse trap car,
                  and further researching about this project, my partner and I were able to create an informative proposal.

                  This is my third journal entry for semester 2. This week my partner and I focused on the calculations behind our design. After researching, we learned that the longer the rod, the more
                  energy it stores. However, based on the body size and weight, it is important to balance out the materials in order to achieve optimum results. Once we finished our calculations, we continued
                  to develop our model through tinker-cad. This software allows us to model how our design would look with accurate dimensions. Like a prototype.

                  This is my fourth journal entry for semester 2. This week my partner and I worked on creating our prototype. We used cardboard as our base, cd's as our wheels, wooden rods as the axle, and straws and string.
                  In order for this model to be completely fnctional and the best it could be, then we had to make sure each of our pieces were the measurements we planned them to be. This biggest 
                  challenge when creating this piece was gluing and sticking everything together. If the wheels were wobbly then the model wouldn't run well. For this reason, we had to attach and detach
                  the wheels multiple times in order for it to move stabely.
